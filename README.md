This repository contains helper scripts for configuring SMTP settings in Nextcloud instances. The scripts are designed to work with YunoHost installations but might work with other Nextcloud setups as well.

## Features

- Simple SMTP configuration through command line
- Support for both authenticated and non-authenticated SMTP servers
- Default configuration for local SMTP servers
- Configuration backup and restore functionality

## Available Script

### `configure_nextcloud_smtp.sh`
A shell script to configure SMTP settings for Nextcloud.

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x configure_nextcloud_smtp.sh
   ```

2. Run the script as root:
   ```bash
   sudo ./configure_nextcloud_smtp.sh
   ```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to configure your SMTP settings.

## Default Values

- SMTP Server: localhost
- SMTP Port: 587
- SMTP Security: tls
- Authentication: disabled by default
- Sender Name: "Nextcloud Server"

## Requirements

- A running Nextcloud instance
- Shell access to the server
- Root privileges
- YunoHost (recommended)

## Known Limitations

- Test mail functionality is limited to configuration verification
- Some Nextcloud versions might require additional manual configuration
- Boolean configuration values might need manual adjustment in some cases

## Backup and Restore

The script automatically creates a backup of your Nextcloud configuration before making changes. You can restore the previous configuration using:

```bash
sudo cp /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php.backup.[TIMESTAMP] /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php
```

A restore script is also created at `/tmp/restore_nextcloud_smtp.sh`.
