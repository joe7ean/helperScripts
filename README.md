This repository contains helper scripts for configuring SMTP settings in Nextcloud instances. The scripts are designed to work with YunoHost installations but might work with other Nextcloud setups as well.

## Purpose

This script was created to solve a common issue in YunoHost Nextcloud installations: While YunoHost provides a built-in SMTP server and configuration, Nextcloud's mail settings are not automatically synchronized with YunoHost's SMTP configuration. This can lead to:

- Nextcloud notifications not being sent
- Password reset emails not working
- Share notifications failing
- Other email-dependent features not functioning

The script bridges this gap by:
1. Configuring Nextcloud to use YunoHost's local SMTP server by default
2. Allowing easy configuration of external SMTP servers if needed
3. Providing a simple way to test and verify the mail configuration

This is particularly important because:
- Nextcloud's default mail settings don't work out of the box with YunoHost
- Manual configuration through the web interface can be error-prone
- Email functionality is crucial for many Nextcloud features
- YunoHost's built-in SMTP server is often the most reliable option for self-hosted instances

> **Note:** While these settings can also be configured using a series of `occ config:system:set` commands, this script provides a more user-friendly and less error-prone way to set up the SMTP configuration. It handles all the necessary commands, creates backups, and provides verification steps in a single, easy-to-use interface.

## Multiple Nextcloud Instances

When running multiple Nextcloud instances on YunoHost (e.g., cloud1.domain.xy, cloud2.domain.xy), there's a specific issue with email delivery:

- The default sender address for additional instances (e.g., cloud2.domain.xy) often causes delivery problems
- Major email providers (like Google) may reject these emails due to the subdomain in the sender address
- Despite YunoHost's proper SPF, DKIM, and other anti-spam configurations
- This configuration is typically reset during Nextcloud updates/upgrades

This script helps maintain the correct sender address configuration, ensuring that:
- Emails are sent from the main domain (domain.xy) instead of the subdomain
- The configuration persists across updates
- Email delivery to major providers remains reliable

## Features

- Simple SMTP configuration through command line
- Support for both authenticated and non-authenticated SMTP servers
- Default configuration for local SMTP servers
- Configuration backup and restore functionality
- Proper sender address configuration for multiple instances

## Available Script

### `configure_nextcloud_smtp.sh`
A shell script to configure SMTP settings for Nextcloud.

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x configure_nextcloud_smtp.sh
   ```

2. Run the script as root:
   ```bash
   sudo ./configure_nextcloud_smtp.sh
   ```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to configure your SMTP settings.

## Default Values

- SMTP Server: localhost
- SMTP Port: 587
- SMTP Security: tls
- Authentication: disabled by default
- Sender Name: "Nextcloud Server"

## Requirements

- A running Nextcloud instance
- Shell access to the server
- Root privileges
- YunoHost (recommended)

## Known Limitations

- Test mail functionality is limited to configuration verification
- Some Nextcloud versions might require additional manual configuration
- Boolean configuration values might need manual adjustment in some cases

## Backup and Restore

The script automatically creates a backup of your Nextcloud configuration before making changes. You can restore the previous configuration using:

```bash
sudo cp /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php.backup.[TIMESTAMP] /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php
```

A restore script is also created at `/tmp/restore_nextcloud_smtp.sh`.
